# instagram_analysis
A project to analyse my Instagram data using Python 3.

You need to request your Instagram data under GDPR(https://help.instagram.com/181231772500920), download the zip file, unzip it and place "instagram_analysis.py" in the folder.
Then you can run it and conduct any analysis manually that you wish.

Please let me know if you have any suggestions/feedback!

The Public API is currently avalible in the docstring following each subroutine in the code.
I will use Semantic Versioning in the future but everything is currently in version 0.0.0 so it could all change at any moment!

I will probably give this some open-source licence which requires attributation but I haven't got round to deciding on which one.
