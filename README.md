# instagram_analysis
A project to analyse my Instagram data using Python 3.

Firstly, you need to request your Instagram data under GDPR(https://help.instagram.com/181231772500920), download the .zip file then unzip it.

*If you are sending me the files for part of my EMC project then run "instagram_anonymise.py" to remove your personal data.*

The "analysis_time.py" and "analysis_user.py" can carry out the analysis you wish to using the files in the specified folder(default current folder).
They require "util.py" in the same folder as them to function.

Please let me know if you have any suggestions/feedback!

The Public API is currently avalible in the docstring following each subroutine in the code.
I will use Semantic Versioning in the future but everything is currently in version 0.0.0 so it could all change at any moment!
