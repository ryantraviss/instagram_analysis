# instagram_analysis
A project to analyse my Instagram data using Python 3.

Firstly, you need to request your Instagram data under GDPR (https://help.instagram.com/181231772500920), download the .zip file then unzip it.

If you wish to remove your personal data then run "instagram_anonymise.py" *note: this means you cannot use "analysis_user.py".*

The "analysis_time.py" and "analysis_user.py" can carry out the analysis you wish to using the files in the specified folder(default current folder).
They require "util.py" in the same folder as them to function.

Please let me know if you have any suggestions/feedback!
